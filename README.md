# HW6_World_Weather

## Overview

#### This week's module has 3 deliverables in the form of programming in Jupyter Notebooks, .csv files and .png images saved to GitHub.

* ### Deliverable 1 [Retrieve Weather Data](https://github.com/ethiry99/HW6_World_Weather/blob/main/Weather_Database/WeatherPy_Database.csv)

    - #### The code randomly creates 2000 latitudes and longitutes, locates the nearest city and determines the current weather characteristics of that city.  The data is written to a .csv for use in the 2nd deliverable. 
    
* ### Deliverable 2 WeatherPy Vacation Map

    - #### After importing the City Weather .csv from deliverable 1, the nearest hotel to each city is determined using a Google API.  These hotels are added to the city weather file and used to create a heat map of locations with hotel name, city and weather conditions.  This map is saved to a .png shown below. ![](https://github.com/ethiry99/HW6_World_Weather/blob/main/Vacation_Search/WeatherPy_vacation_map.png)

* ### Deliverable 3 Vacation Itenerary Map

    - #### The WeatherPy_vacation data is imported to a new Jupyter Notebook and used to identify 4 cities to create a map of a road trip.  Once the routed is determined via a Google API it is mapped and has markers created and displayed with hotel, city, country and current weather information.![](https://github.com/ethiry99/HW6_World_Weather/blob/main/Vacation_Itinerary/WeatherPy_travel_map_markers.png)
