# HW6_World_Weather

## Overview

#### This week's module has 3 deliverables in the form of programming in Jupyter Notebooks, .csv files and .png images saved to GitHub.

* ### Deliverable 1 [Retrieve Weather Data](https://github.com/ethiry99/HW6_World_Weather/blob/main/Weather_Database/WeatherPy_Database.csv)

    - #### The code randomly creates 2000 latitudes and longitutes, locates the nearest city and determines the current weather characteristics of that city.  The data is written to a .csv for use in the 2nd deliverable. 
    
* ### Deliverable 2 WeatherPy Vacation Map

    - #### After importing the City Weather .csv from deliverable 1, the nearest hotel to each city is determined using a Google API.  These hotels are added to the city weather file and used to create a heat map of locations with city, hotel name and weather conditions.  This map is saved to a .png shown below. ![]
